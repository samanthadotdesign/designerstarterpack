# Designer Starter Pack

## :seedling:	Background
1. As a product designer at a lean product startup, I have been bringing my non-designer colleagues closer to the product development process via Figma. Simply having more people find a page and add their comments benefits the entire team.  
2. Through my experiences designing and conducting Figma workshops for Tech for She, Friends of Figma Singapore, Padang.Co, and at Funding Societies, I've become more aware of how different beginners learn.

## :zap: User Problem
1. For a non-designer (or team member from a non-tech background), Figma can be intimidating. 
2. Figma as a design tool changes very quickly. Auto-Layout 3.0, interactive components, and variants (all launched Sep 2020) are game-changing features. 
3. There are so many great resources available – from tutorials that introduce the tool broadly to detailed guides that apply to a niche problem. 

## :rainbow: Objective
Interactive skill map to keep track of resources and learning, for beginners that reflect industry expectations 

## :anchor: Features

###### REGISTRATION
1. User registration
2. User login
3. User forgets password (nice-to-have)

###### TRACK SKILL PROGRESS
1. When the user is logged into dashboard, user wants to view completed and remaining skills, so user is aware of proficiency. 
2. When the user is mastering a particular skill, user wants to view recommended resources, so user saves time from searching elsewhere. 
3. When the user is confident with a particular skill, user wants to mark a skill as proficient, so user can keep track of progress.
4. When user finds a helpful resource that is not included on the app, user wants to add the resource, so user can review the resource later. (nice-to-have) 
5. When user has finished with the entire skill map, user wants to share skill map with others, so user can participate in the community. (nice-to-have)
6. When user is a non-designer, user wants to see skills only relevant to their profession, so user can have fewer requirements and finish quickly. (nice-to-have)
